Description of the project:
Penguin Ball
- We wanted to develop a 3d game in which the user plays as a penguin playing football in a stadium.
- We created an envirenment which looks like a stadium in a snowy envirenment(background icicles).
- The user plays against a ai goalkeeper and trys to score against the ai

Instructions for use

***** Menu *****
- Play - Enter Game
- Exit - Exit Game

***** In-Game *****
- Left Click = Shoot (hold to power shot)
- Space-Bar = Jump
- W = Move Forward
- Shift + w = Sprint
- S = Move Backwards
- A = Move Left
- D = Move Right
- CTRL = Slide
   
How it works
- Using the controls set out in "Instruction for Use" , try to score on the Goal-Keeper
- Once a goal is scored , there will be cool music, particles and a cool banner.(the ball will be returned to the center)
- When Ball goes out of bounds, it will be returned to center of the field
- Different particles displayed when sprinting, sliding, jumping
- The Ai goalkeeper will attempt to save your shots and hit away the ball
- Holding down the shoot button will charge up a shot
- Stamina bar in the top left (will decrease based on sprinting)

What we are most proud of in the assignment
- We are most proud of the collaborative effort and creativity demonstrated in developing Penguin Ball. 
- The creation of a 3D game environment, complete with a snowy stadium, AI goalkeeper, and interactive gameplay, showcases a comprehensive understanding of game development principles.
- Additionally, the incorporation of various assets, scenes, and controls demonstrates a well-rounded approach to building an engaging gaming experience.

What we learned
- Through the development of Penguin Ball, We gained valuable insights into game design, 3D modeling, particle effects, and audio integration.
- The use of Godot Engine for scripting and scene creation provided a hands-on learning experience, allowing for the implementation of player controls, AI behavior, and visual/audio enhancements.
- The project's diverse set of features, from goal celebrations to shooting mechanics, reflects a broadened skill set in game development and a deeper understanding of the Godot Engine's capabilities.

Description of the project: Penguin Penalty Shootout

In our project we will be developing a vr experience where the user scores the winning penalty at the penguin world cup.
We hope to make an immersive and fun envirenment. We hope to prove a envirenment where the user feels as though they are particiating in the football world.
We hope to implement cool 3d visuals and sound effects such as the crowd, the fans and the swooshing of the net. We hope to focus on a simple controls as to cater to a broader audience of all capabilities.
